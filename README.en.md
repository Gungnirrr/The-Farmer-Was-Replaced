# Code Farm Project Introduction

## Project Overview
Code Farm is a collection of scripts related to various plants, crops, and game mechanics. This project primarily focuses on simulating plant behaviors across different versions and is suitable for game development or algorithm research scenarios.

## Main Features
- Provides scripts for simulating various plant behaviors (e.g., cactus, pumpkin, sunflower).
- Includes multiple script versions to support diverse functional requirements (e.g., single-version and multi-version implementations).
- Offers basic movement functions and auxiliary functions.

## File Structure
- `catcus_v1.py`: Contains the `sort_x` and `sort_y` functions for sorting operations.
- `f0.py`: Provides the `move_abs` and `move_abs1` functions for absolute movement calculations.
- `snake.py`: Contains the `move_abs` function for snake-like movement simulation.
- Other files such as `Weird_byFertilizer.py`, `bush_v1.py`, `carrot_v1.py`, etc., currently lack detailed functional descriptions.

## Installation and Usage
### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitee.com/F-xy/code-farm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd code-farm
   ```

### Usage Instructions
Select the appropriate script file based on your specific needs. For example, using the sorting functions from `catcus_v1.py`:
```python
from catcus_v1 import sort_x, sort_y

# Sample data
x = [3, 1, 2]
y = [5, 4, 6]
size = len(x)

# Call sorting functions
sorted_x = sort_x(x, size)
sorted_y = sort_y(y, size)

print("Sorted X:", sorted_x)
print("Sorted Y:", sorted_y)
```
